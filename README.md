What is the Point of Our App? 
Thus, this awesome app functions somewhat like a personal age friend. When you tell it your age, it responds with interesting historical information about people who were your age at various moments throughout time and that died that age. 
The Reason I Made It 
I aimed to add some joy and relatability to the learning process. Who does not enjoy a nice trivia session, too? With this software, you can easily and rather amusingly establish connections with historical figures. 
How It Operates 
Simply enter your age, click "Search," and give it a moment! The software will spit out a short fact of information about a person who was once your age and who died at that age. Like having an interesting past.
The Design Behind the Scenes
Now, let's talk about how I put this app together.
Keeping It Simple
I wanted the app to be easy-peasy to use, so I kept the design clean and straightforward. No fancy bells and whistles, just type in your age and let the magic happen.
Making It Look Good
Even though I kept it simple, we still wanted it to look cool. So, we picked some nice colours, added a few nice and amazing pictures, and there we have it! An amazing app that's easy on the eyes.
GitHub Submission
It was super difficult submitting the finished app to GitHub as I did not have any knowledge of GitHub prior to this Assignment, but I managed to watch multiple YouTube videos and help from my classmates, and I did it.
What I used to make the app
I used Android Studio to design the user interface and to code the app.
 

Version Control
Ever accidentally delete something important? Yeah, it happens. But with GitHub, we could track every change we made to the code. So, if something went wrong, we could roll back to a previous version without breaking a sweat.
Bug Squashing
Speaking of things going wrong, bugs are a fact of life in app development. But GitHub helped us stay organized and tackle those pesky bugs one by one. Plus, we could see who was working on what, so nobody stepped on each other's toes.
Wrapping It Up
So, that's the scoop on our app and how we made it happen. We wanted to make learning fun, and with a little help from GitHub, we think we nailed it. So, go ahead, punch in your age, and let the history lesson begin!
Title: Exploring the Purpose and Design Considerations of the App "Age Comparison" with GitHub Utilization
Abstract: The "Age Comparison" app serves as an educational tool that allows users to learn about historical figures and iconic personalities by comparing their ages with those of the user. This report delves into the purpose behind the creation of the app, the design considerations taken into account during development, and the utilisation of GitHub for collaborative and version-controlled software development. By examining these aspects, we gain insights into the app's educational value, user experience, and the advantages of employing GitHub in the development process.
1. Introduction: The "Age Comparison" app aims to provide users with an engaging and educational experience by leveraging historical figures and their ages as a point of comparison. By inputting their age, users can discover which historical figures shared the same age and learn about their accomplishments, contributions, and significance in history. This report explores the motivations behind the development of the app, the design considerations that influenced its creation, and the role of GitHub in facilitating collaborative software development.
2. Purpose of the App: The primary purpose of the "Age Comparison" app is to make learning about historical figures more interactive and personalized. By connecting users with historical figures who shared the same age, the app creates a sense of relevance and relatability, making history more accessible and engaging. Moreover, the app serves as a valuable educational resource, offering users insights into the lives and achievements of notable individuals from various fields such as politics, science, arts, and sports.
3. Design Considerations: Several design considerations were considered during the development of the "Age Comparison" app to ensure an intuitive user experience and optimal educational value:
⦁	User Interface (UI): The UI was designed to be simple, intuitive, and visually appealing, with clear navigation and minimalistic design elements. This approach enhances usability and ensures that users can easily input their age and view the results without any confusion.
⦁	Content Presentation: Historical figures are presented in a concise and informative manner, with brief descriptions of their achievements and contributions. This allows users to quickly grasp the significance of each figure and understand their relevance to history.
⦁	Age Matching Algorithm: The app employs an efficient age matching algorithm to identify historical figures who shared the same age as the user. This algorithm ensures accurate and relevant results, enhancing the educational value of the app.
⦁	Error Handling: Robust error handling mechanisms were implemented to handle invalid user inputs and unexpected errors gracefully. Clear error messages guide users in correcting their inputs and provide a seamless user experience.
⦁	Accessibility: Considerations for accessibility were integrated into the app's design, ensuring that users with disabilities can navigate and interact with the app effectively. This includes support for screen readers, colour contrast enhancements, and adjustable font sizes.
4. Utilisation of GitHub: GitHub played a crucial role in the development of the "Age Comparison" app, offering several advantages for collaborative and version-controlled software development:
⦁	Version Control: GitHub provides robust version control capabilities, allowing developers to track changes to the codebase, revert to previous versions if needed, and collaborate on code seamlessly. This ensures that the app's codebase remains organised, well-documented, and free from errors.
⦁	Collaboration: GitHub facilitates collaboration among developers by providing tools for code review, issue tracking, and project management. Developers can collaborate on features, discuss improvements, and resolve issues efficiently, leading to a more cohesive and polished product.
⦁	Code Quality: GitHub enables developers to maintain code quality standards through features such as code review, automated testing, and continuous integration. This ensures that the app's codebase adheres to best practices, is free from bugs, and performs reliably across different devices and platforms.
⦁	Community Engagement: GitHub fosters a vibrant community of developers, enthusiasts, and contributors who can contribute to the app's development through feedback, suggestions, and contributions. This community-driven approach promotes innovation, fosters knowledge sharing, and enhances the overall quality of the app.
5. Conclusion: In conclusion, the "Age Comparison" app serves as an innovative educational tool that leverages historical figures to engage users and facilitate learning. By exploring the purpose of the app, the design considerations that influenced its development, and the utilization of GitHub for collaborative software development, we gain valuable insights into its educational value, user experience, and development process. Moving forward, continued enhancements and Refinements to the app, coupled with active community engagement on GitHub, will further enrich the learning experience and ensure its continued success.
